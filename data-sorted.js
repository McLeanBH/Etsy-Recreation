I will allow returns only under certain conditions and this will include  a 35% restocking fees.\r\n\r\nATTENTION *** Please be careful on what size you choose. All listings have size charts from my shirt suppliers. Please check the MEASUREMENTS on the size charts. I offer 8 different sizes (Ladies S, M, L, XL, Unisex S, M, L, XL). I also now offer many shirt colors. Measure yourself and then compare your measurements on the size chart to see which size best fits you. \r\n\r\n\u2022 If there has been an error on my part with your order, I definitely will be happy to fix the error.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you have made a mistake in giving me the wrong size, I can not give you an exchange or refund so please be sure to give me the correct size of the shirt you want to purchase because every item is made to order.  \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Our Ladies Fitted Tees DO RUN SMALL. These are form-fitting shirts. Please order one 1 or 2 sizes up if needed and only if needed. Some women ordered a Unisex size for a comfortable fit. For most people, it seems that they&#39;re fine with the size. It really depends on each person.\u2028 Please note that I have no way of knowing what size you really need. Only you will know. I can only give a simple advice on figuring out the size. One way to tell is if you measure yourself from armpit to armpit and then compare your measurements on the size chart to see which size best fits you. If ordering for someone else, try to get a hold of one of their shirts and lay it flat, then measure it from armpit to armpit. SIZE CHARTS are on the listings.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please be aware that I DON&#39;T EXCHANGE sizes because each shirt is custom made to order. I also don&#39;t allow returns because the shirt didn&#39;t fit. I&#39;m sorry but I have to make sure that each customer really does their best to look at the size charts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;d like to change the size you just ordered, let me know ASAP before my next scheduled print day. I just want to make sure that you receive the exact shirt you were expecting. I really want to do my best to make you happy with my products. All that I ask is for each customer to do their best to make sure they look at the size chart and figure out the size that they really need, and I&#39;ll do my best to print the designs as best as possible. If purchasing the iPhone cases, please read the descriptions carefully so that you&#39;ll know what to expect. My job is to make the item as best as I can. I do work very hard on each item I make. I now turn around orders as fast as possible whether it&#39;s a holiday or it&#39;s my birthday, I will work hard to send out the orders as fast as I can. As you can see from my feedbacks, many customers are very happy with my handmade products.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow a slight variation on the final shirt print color and iphone designs. Sometimes colors slightly vary for each item since each one is handmade. Also, allow a slight placement difference on the printed shirt as each design is printed by hand.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Because we have so many designs and we offer so many sizes and colors that no two people will order the same exact design on the same exact size and color of shirt. This is also one of the reasons we can&#39;t allow size exchanges. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Because there are so many costs associated with selling and producing of shirts and phone cases and because of the nature of my custom made to order items, I can&#39;t allow exchanges on sizes or returns because the shirt didn&#39;t fit. All items are final. There may be rare occasions if I will approve a return. If a return is approved, a 35% restocking fee will be applied to the cost of the unused and undamaged item.

Everything in our shop is sourced by us, and hand crafted by us in our little studio which is filled to the rafters with lots and lots of old books.\r\n\r\nWe are always adding items to the shop, often daily, so check back regularly to see if we have the print you want.","policy_payment":"We prefer Paypal, because its just so easy for you and for us. For Australian buyers we offer direct deposit, just contact us after you place your order.\r\n\r\nMost of our customers pay at time of purchase, but if you need a little time to pay just convo us and we&#39;ll work something out. I know what its like when you just HAVE to have something!\r\n\r\nSo far we haven&#39;t had anyone cancel or ask to cancel their order with us - so this hasn&#39;t been an issue. However, once we have shipped your order and your print is on its way to you it would be impossible to cancel your order.","policy_shipping":"We ship prints as quickly as possible, shipping every week day. Depending on when you place your order, and the time of day it is here in Australia, often your order will be packaged and at the post office the same day.\r\n\r\nOur shipping costs are based on the real postage cost to send items to you. And yes, I have taken things down to our local post office and asked them to weigh them and give me accurate postage costs. (The people standing in line weren&#39;t too happy!) We allow a small amount for the envelopes and bags we use, but don&#39;t charge for our time to pack and ship your order,\r\n\r\nAnd, we pop a little something extra into ALL parcels. Just as a little thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING WITHIN AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nWe ship via Australia Post, which means it reaches most destinations either the next day or within a few days.\r\n\r\nIf you need something in a hurry, just let us know and we can offer Express Post delivery. If you want to keep track of your order and ensure it reaches you we can offer Registered Post. Both of these options will have a small additional cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING TO USA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE\r\n\r\nWe ship via Australia Post, using first class International Airmail. The official estimate of delivery time is 5 to 10 working days, however customers have received parcels in as little as 3 days or as long a 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nIf you need need something in a hurry, or you want to track your order, just convo us before you place your order and we&#39;ll work out the best and cheapest option for doing this. \r\n\r\n\r\nLOST PARCELS\r\n\r\nSo far (touch wood with crossed fingers) we haven&#39;t had a lost package in the five years we have been selling via Etsy. We&#39;ve had two slow deliveries, but the parcels have reached their destination in the end. You can appreciate that once we ship your parcel, we have no control over how quickly it reaches you.\r\n\r\nIf your parcel is lost, we offer a replacement item (if we have one) or a similar item from our current stock. ","policy_refunds":"We don&#39;t offer refunds generally, and to date we haven&#39;t had any need to refund someone&#39;s money.\r\n\r\nIf an item is lost or is damaged during shipping, we will do our best to offer you a replacement item (if we have another one) or a similar item from our current stock. To date we haven&#39;t had a lost or damaged item in the 5 years we have been selling via Etsy.\r\n\r\nIf you receive your item and its not what you ordered, or were expecting (I did ship a lady the wrong garland once!) we would send you the right one (she got the right garland in the end!) or offer a replacement.","policy_additional":"CONDITION \r\n\r\nOur items are old - they are real pages from antique or vintage books. They have lived a life, and been read and handled by people in the past. Sometimes they show their age, and we believe that&#39;s part of their appeal.\r\n\r\nThe majority of items we sell are in good condition for their age. If there are obvious marks, dark spots or other imperfections we mention this in the item description. Sometimes there might be a small tear in the margin of the page, and often this will be covered  by the matt once you frame the print. We don&#39;t sell damaged, ripped or scribbled upon items. \r\n\r\nIMAGES\r\n\r\nThe beauty of these vintage prints, in particular their paper, colours and printing can not be represented accurately via a digital image, however we have done our best. Colors, tones and contrast vary from monitor to monitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n\r\nMost of our items are pages from vintage books, and we feel its important for you to know where they have come from so that you know they are REAL vintage items and you know how old they are. So we include publication and printing information with each print we sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKAGING\r\n\r\nI&#39;m a graphic designer, so you can expect our packaging to look good. And to have nice typography.\r\n\r\nOur prints are packaged with a piece of recycled mount board, within a clear peel n&#39; seal bag. On the back is the publication information. They look good enough to give just like that if you don&#39;t want to frame them.\r\n\r\nOur garlands and bunting are packaged with recycled mount board and a clear peel n&#39; seal bag too, finished with a label with details about each item.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT WRAPPING\r\n\r\nWe can gift warp your order, just let us know in the &quot;buyers message&quot; section when you place your order. Plus let us know who its for (child, woman, man) so we don&#39;t wrap your Dad&#39;s birthday present in a vintage floral paper.\r\n\r\nThere is no extra cost for gift wrapping. And we can ship directly to them if you are running out of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS\r\n\r\nWe just love it when one of our prints finds the perfect home. A lady bought a print of a cross-section of the Queen Mary, a famous English ship - it was a present for her Dad who had worked on the ship in the engine room. She said he would love it.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a quirky, unusual or specific need, just convo us and we&#39;ll do our best to help you out.\r\n\r\nOur garlands, bunting and art blocks can be custom made - just let us know the size and design you want and we&#39;ll make something just for you.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1348129062,"vacation_autoreply":"Thanks for stopping by - I&#39;m away at a market & the shop is closed for a week or so.\r\nI&#39;ll be back soon with more lovely vintage prints!\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nMartine","url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/theStoryOfVintage?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/044\/0\/5871846\/iusb_760x100.13465590_iyag.jpg","num_favorers":3024,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null}},{"listing_id":127357614,"state":"active","user_id":14932202,"category_id":69192033,"title":"Chimpanzee Print, Monkey Art, Justice Tarot Card,  8x10 Wall Art, Wildlife Decor, Balance Art, Animal Illustration, Animism Tarot Deck","description":"The Animism Tarot deck:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ca\/listing\/183713520\r\n\r\n This 8x10 art print features original artwork of the Justice tarot card: a pair of chimpanzees both raise their hands to the other&#39;s; their eyes are drawn to each other.

It is solid and three-dimensional and well detailed, right down to individual fingers and toes (to say nothing of an awesome long tail and exquisite monkey face!).   The charm measures approximately  23mm tall, 11mm wide and 8mm deep.  This listing contains multiple photos and a detailed description (keep scrolling down for additional information!) If you have any other questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nMaterial: solid .925 sterling silver\r\nSize (mm): 23mm tall, 11mm wide and 8mm deep\r\nSize (inches): just under 1&quot; (15\/16&quot;) tall, about 3\/8&quot; wide and 5\/16&quot; deep\r\nMade in the USA\r\n\r\nYou can find other primate \/ monkey themed charms in my store here:\r\nwww.etsy.com\/shop\/jewelbecharmed\/search?search_query=monkey\r\n\r\nPlease note that the charm measurements do not include the length of any removable attachments.  These will vary some, but a jump ring or split ring would add about 4mm (1\/8&quot;) onto the overall length, a lobster clasp about 10mm (3\/8&quot;), and a large hole bead about 13mm (1\/2&quot;).\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nAttachment options:\r\nSelect an attachment for this charm!  All are solid .925 sterling silver.  If you&#39;re not sure which one you need, choose the jump ring.  To see samples of the different attachments offered, please refer to the last photo in this listing.\r\n\r\nNONE ADDED: no attachment will be added for you.  To put the charm on your jewelry, you will need to add your own attachment later, such as a jump ring.  The closed loop (usually at the very top) of a charm is permanent and will still be on the charm!  If you&#39;re not sure what I&#39;m referring to, look at the last picture in this listing.  Each of the sample size charms have their permanent closed loop at the top, those will not be removed.  In that same picture, you can see how the different attachment options need to be inserted through that loop, and only then can the charm be added to jewelry.\r\n\t\r\nJUMP RING (most popular): slide your charm onto a necklace chain or attach it to a traditional chain style charm bracelet with this option.  A jump ring can be opened and closed with pliers.  While you don&#39;t have to, you could have a jeweler permanently solder the jump ring shut after it&#39;s on your bracelet for maximum security.  I use a sturdy 18 or 19 gauge jump ring, the 18 whenever possible and the 19 on charms with smaller loops (most common with miniature charms).\r\n\r\nSPLIT RING: some people prefer a split ring when attaching a charm to a bracelet.  A split ring is similar to a jump ring, but has a double loop like a keychain.  I use a 6mm split ring on all charms that will fit one, and smaller rings when necessary.\r\n\r\nLOBSTER CLASP: people who like to change their charms frequently may prefer this option, as you can quickly clip it on and off your jewelry. I use a small 9mm lobster clasp for these. As this is a smaller clasp, it will fit on many traditional chain style bracelets, but not on thick or European style chains.\r\n\r\nPENDANT BAIL: adding a pendant bail to a charm gives it a nice, finished look if you intend to use the charm as a pendant on a necklace. A charm with a pendant bail attached will arrive ready to slide on a chain for a unique necklace! The bail (see example #6 in the last photo above) is a little less than 10mm tall and 4mm wide, the opening is about 2mm x 4mm, so it will fit on chains or cords measuring less than 2mm wide. Please note that miniature charms may have a miniature pendant bail attached instead (#5 in the photo above), which measures a bit smaller than the other bail but has a similar sized opening.\r\n\r\nLARGE HOLE BEAD: these are necessary if you wish to add the charm to a European style charm bracelet, the other attachment options will not work with those. The bead has an inner diameter just under 6mm across and will fit on popular brands of European style bracelets and thicker chains or cord. You can pick the bead style you want from the following options, just leave me a note when you checkout with your choice (pictures of these can be found in the last photo above).  If you don&#39;t indicate a preference, I will pick one for you.\r\nA = Narrow plain\r\nB = Narrow beaded\r\nC = Curved inwards\r\nD = Beaded (most popular)\r\nE = Spiral\r\nF = Textured inner band\r\nG = Banded\r\nH = Rectangles with square cutouts\r\nI = Triangles with cutouts\r\nJ = Southwestern style cutout\r\nK = Arrow \/ arrowhead cutout\r\nL = Squared\r\nM = Plain\r\nN = Dotted\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nQuantity:\r\nThe price listed is for one (1) charm. I have this listing set up to only let you order what is IN STOCK and ready to ship.  (For example... if Etsy only lets you add 1 of this item to your cart, that&#39;s because I only have 1.  If it lets you order 20, then I do have 20 available.) If you need more than what is currently available, I can special order any number of most of the items in my store, but please allow 2-4 weeks for special orders.  To view current information on discounts available for larger orders, please refer to my store&#39;s Policy page:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/jewelbecharmed\/policy\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nShipping:\r\nMost items from my store, including charms, qualify for flat rate shipping. The shopping cart will automatically combine multiple purchases from my store into one order. Standard shipping for orders is with USPS first class mail, which averages 2-4 business days for delivery within the U.S. You may select an alternate shipping method in your shopping cart if you prefer.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nAdditional information for international orders:\r\nFor international mail (including Canada), first class delivery is usually within 2-4 weeks. Please note that I have no control over whether your country may or may not charge you importation fees, duties or tariffs when they deliver your package and I am not responsible for those. I also will not falsify customs documents, so please do not ask. Expect shipping delays around the holidays! International mail can move very slowly the entire month of December and beyond. \r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nOrdering gifts:\r\nI can mail your purchase directly to the gift recipient if you wish. Leave me a note at checkout telling me it&#39;s a gift so I know not to include an invoice. Confirm the shipping address and give me your name or a gift message to include in the box, so the recipient knows who their gift is from! I do not offer gift wrapping services, but can pack your purchase in a little gift bag or paper gift box by request.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nInterested in this charm on finished jewelry?\r\nDo you love this charm, but prefer it on finished, ready-to-wear jewelry?

NO REPRODUCTIONS, EVER!\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? Because, purchasing and owning an original antique print is an investment in a piece of art from the past. In our digital world of quick art reproduction, these pieces truly stand out as works of art that are not being made anymore. All of my prints are antique or vintage, dating from 1800. The collection includes hand colored engravings, wood-cut, steel & copper engravings, lithographs, and chromolithographs. I hope you enjoy browsing the collection and will stop by the shop often!\r\n\r\nWhen purchasing a matted print, please keep in mind:\r\n\r\n-I do all of my own matting.\r\n\r\n-All mats are cut at a 45 degree bevel.\r\n\r\n-Most of the art requires custom cut mat and window sizing to display the art properly. This ensures that your print has been matted perfectly and is ready to frame or display as you choose. The benefit of buying matted prints is that the work has been done for you! \r\n\r\n-Most of my pieces are finished in standard sizes (8x10, 11x14, etc), allowing my customers the opportunity to choose from the popular, inexpensive and ever-increasing, ready-made frames available at craft and department stores (we like Michael&#39;s) if they choose.\r\n\r\n-Due to time constraints, I am not able to substitute mats for different colors or remove mats. Depending on the piece, we use 3 standard mat colors: antique ivory, black, or off-white. \r\n\r\n-All materials used in matting are high-quality and acid-free, ensuring the protection and longevity of your print. \r\n\r\n-All prints, matted and un-matted, are packaged in a clear, plastic protective bag and are carefully packaged for shipping either in cardboard and padded envelope or shipping tube for safe delivery. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for prints in a specific theme or category (ie: a pair of bunny prints for your nursery, a collection of botanicals for a room in your home, etc.), feel free to contact me as I will happy to work with you! \r\n\r\nThank you for visiting my shop and please check back often as I will add new inventory regularly. \r\n\r\n-Octavia","policy_payment":"We accept:\r\nCredit Cards (Etsy Direct Checkout)\r\nPayPal\r\nEtsy Gift Cards","policy_shipping":"**Order by Dec. 16th for delivery before Christmas** (Within US Only)\r\n\r\nWe ship via United States Post Office.

The length of each tattoo will depend on a number of factors - how often you shower, how much you sweat, and how much your clothes rub against the tattooed area (unless your often naked... In which case is a bonus for you!). Another factor depends on the body area, high motion areas can effect tattoo life. a list of low motion areas you may want to use your tattoo on to lengthen its life are: Chests, top of hands, forearms, triceps, shoulders, feet, and legs.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u27b3 SKIN Sensitivity: I am addicted to these tattoos, constantly wear them freaking out my mother and most of all my mother in law.

I will have a small series of questions for you then if I feel you followed directions for your tattoo properly I will give you a choice, one is I can send you a new product with a couple little gifts, since sometimes glue and dye issues can arise after the printer has ran for a while. Or your second option is a refund of that specific tattoo.

This is additional security for both buyer and seller!  \u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6\r\n\r\n\u2665 My shipping fees are based on the weight and bulk of each item.  The shipping fee pays for not only the postage on your package, but also packaging (bubble mailer envelope, bubble wrap, tape, plastic baggies, shipping labels, etc.) and gas to the Post Office.  I also have to pay credit processing fees, state taxes, and federal taxes on those fees.  I do not refund any portion of the shipping fee if the actual cost of postage is less than the amount collected.  I also don&#39;t charge you additional fees if the actual cost is more. \r\n\r\n\u2665 I process orders every night and almost always ship the next business day after payment is received. But I am a one woman show and every once in a while I may need a little time off. So please allow up to 2 business days for your order to be processed and shipped.   \r\n\r\n\u2665 US orders are shipped USPS First Class Mail in a bubble padded envelope.  Domestic First Class Mail usually takes 2-5 days.  I provide a tracking number so you can track your package&#39;s progress.  While the vast majority of my packages take less than 5 days for delivery, please allow up to 2 weeks for delivery due to unexpected USPS delays.\r\n\r\n\u2665 If you need faster shipping to a USA address, you can choose a Priority or Express upgrade in your cart.  Look on the right side of your cart BEFORE you click on the green Proceed to Checkout button!  Priority normally takes 2-3 days for delivery but is not guaranteed.  Express normally takes 1-2 days for delivery and is guaranteed delivery in at least 2 days.  Delays can be expected during bad weather or peak shipping seasons.  Processing times will still be 1-2 business days.  I do not provide same day rush order processing.\r\n\r\n2015 USPS Holidays \r\n(no mail service on these days so I can&#39;t ship orders)\r\nThur, January 1 - New Year&#39;s Day\r\nMon, January 19 - Martin Luther King, Jr. birthday\r\nMon, February 16 - President&#39;s Day\r\nMon, May 25 - Memorial Day\r\nSat, July 4 - Independence Day\r\nMon, September 7 - Labor Day\r\nMon, October 12 - Columbus Day\r\nWed, November 11 - Veterans\u2019 Day\r\nThurs, November 26 - Thanksgiving Day\r\nFri, December 25 - Christmas Day\r\n\r\n\u2665 I re-use packing supplies as much as possible to save costs and the environment.  I also combine multiple quantities of the same item in the same package when possible.  \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  INTERNATIONAL   SHIPPING !  &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\r\n\r\n\u2665 International orders (outside the USA):\r\n- Orders are shipped USPS International First Class Mail in a bubble padded envelope.  Delivery tracking is available for a few countries.  See the list below.\r\n- If you do not live in one of those countries, in order to receive a tracking number, you will need to upgrade your shipping to USPS International Priority Express Mail which is rather expensive.  Please contact me for pricing PRIOR to placing your order.\r\n- I will not label your package as \u201cgift\u201d or alter the product value on the Customs Form as that is illegal.\r\n- The customer is responsible for all customs and duty fees associated with their purchases. \r\n- While most packages take around 1-2 weeks for delivery, please allow up to 4-6 weeks for delivery of international packages, as it is completely dependent on the time it takes to clear customs and the speed of the various international postal services.  Some countries such as Brazil, Italy, Russia, and Spain may take up to 8 weeks.\r\n- If you need faster shipping, you can choose a Priority shipping upgrade during checkout.  USPS states it normally takes 6-10 days for delivery, however that cannot be guaranteed due to the reasons stated above.\r\n\r\n\u2665 I recommend purchasing upgraded Priority Express International shipping with tracking if your location has a history of poor postal service.  Those upgraded fees are not included in the posted shipping fees.  \r\n- Priority Express International shipping starts at $47 for up to 4 pounds in a padded envelope.\r\n- Please contact me PRIOR to purchase and I will be happy to set up a reserved  listing with the upgraded shipping fees.\r\n\r\n\u2665 The United States Postal Service provides delivery tracking for the following countries.  Your Shipment Confirmation email will contain the Customs Form number which is also the tracking number.\r\nAustralia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Great Britain, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, & Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\u2665 While I will do everything in my power to make sure your order reaches you safely and in a timely manner, it is also dependent upon the USPS and the various international postal services.  If a package is delayed or missing, please let me know and I will work with you to try and locate the package. Lost packages take time to locate so please be patient as we work through the process with the USPS and your local post offices.  If not located, or a package is damaged in shipment, I will work with you to make your shopping experience here as pleasant as possible.  ","policy_refunds":"\u2665 If you are not completely thrilled with your purchase, please contact me immediately. I will gladly provide a refund under these conditions:\r\n- Item(s) must be shipped back to me within 15 days of receipt of your order in its original, unused condition and in secure packaging.  Please use my original packaging, if possible.\r\n- Refund for the item purchase price will be processed once items are received and verified they are in original condition.\r\n- All shipping to be paid by the buyer.  \r\n- I highly recommend that you return the item(s) with Delivery Confirmation since I cannot provide you with a refund if I don&#39;t receive the item(s).  Obviously it&#39;s not required, just highly recommended.  Please provide me with the Delivery Confirmation number so I can track the item&#39;s return.\r\n-  Etsy does not have a process for exchanges or credits so I can only process refunds.\r\n\r\n\u2665 If you receive a package or item that has been damaged in transit, please take a clear photo of the issue and send me an Etsy Convo immediately (or at least within 15 days of receipt of your order.)  I will work with you to make your shopping experience here as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\n\u2665 I am a one woman show and I&#39;m only human.  On the rare occasion that I make a mistake on your order, please send me an Etsy Convo immediately (or at least within 15 days of receipt of your order) and send me a clear photo of the issue.  I will make it right as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\u2665 Most items in my shop are plated metal alloys and they will tarnish and the finish will eventually wear.  It all depends on the care they are given.  Just like precious metal jewelry, plated products should be kept in air-tight packaging or containers to keep tarnish at bay.  Occasional, gentle cleaning with a polishing cloth will also help keep tarnish away.  I sell polishing cloths and anti-tarnish paper which also helps keep tarnish away!  If exposed to damaging elements like water, sweat, lotion, soap, shampoo, perfume, hairspray, etc., the plating won&#39;t last as long or may turn colors. Plated items are not the same price or quality as sterling silver or gold-filled products. Refunds or exchanges will not be accepted on plated items that have been used, damaged, and\/or tarnished, as that is the natural process for plated items.","policy_additional":"\u2665 My shop is a smoke free, cat loving home.
